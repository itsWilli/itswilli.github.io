                gotta put my models and things here!<br>
                I got into 3D modeling main beacuse of Game Development back in 2016 picking up Blender. Later at Community College I was taught Maya, ZBrush Substance Painter, and Houdini!<br>
        
                You might see models from other projects in here!<br>
