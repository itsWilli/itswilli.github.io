        I've been programming since 2016~ish. Mainly self-taught other than HTML. Programming is something that I love way more than I should.<br>
        For example this website is created the same way I was taught, <b>Notepad</b>. Pure Notepad and saving as. Not even CSS!<br>
        Here's the Languages I know:<br>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Lua</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS</li>
        <li>Maya MEL Script</li><br> 
        
        Recently, I'm super big on making things myself without (mostly) outside help and tools. For example, figurng out how to make graphics display in a window blows my mind. I love it! <br>
        Creating things for others to use/play brings me happiness which strives me to continue creating!<br>
        <br><br>
        Here is an array of things I've done over the years<br>
