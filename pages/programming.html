        I've been programming since 2016~ish. Mainly self-taught other than HTML. Programming is something that I love way more than I should.<br>
        For example this website is created the same way I was taught, <b>Notepad</b>. Pure Notepad and saving as. Not even CSS!<br>
        Here's the Languages I know:<br>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Lua</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS</li>
        <li>Maya MEL Script</li><br> 
        
        Recently, I'm super big on making things myself without (mostly) outside help and tools. For example, figurng out how to make graphics display in a window blows my mind. I love it! <br>
        Creating things for others to use/play brings me happiness which strives me to continue creating!<br>
        <br>This is in ordered from recent to oldest. And note the gap between some projects. Just because there might be big gaps doesn't mean I wasn't working!
        You might see models and things from other projects in here!<br><br>

        <div style ="font-size:20px"> Rigging / Blending Menu - April 2021  </div>
        <div style ="margin:auto; width: 70%;">So for every modlue for College we had to do a 'scripting' part to coincide with the rest of the module. Since I had prior knowledge, learning MEL scripting/Phyton was pretty easy to do! 
            I created a menu for each module. However, with Rigging I really took it another step with creating 2 seperate menus.<br>
            One was something alluded to by the tutor with creating a way to streamline the 'Colourblending' process as it was extremely tedious to set up. I took it too far and created a full menu for it with the intention for other classmates to use (which they did) and even the option for it to generate a slider already setup with limits and everything to just work!<br>
            The other is 'Rigging Menu' full of useful shortcuts to help speed up the workflow of creating rigs inside of Maya. I made sure everything was concise and made sense. I even made custom icons!
            I was given the highest marks for that module and the tutor asked me to create a help sheet for future people to help with understanding programming!

        <div style ="margin:auto; width: 70%;">Codename: Combo was the firs time I tried to learn shaders and developing an 'artstyle' for the game. The game was me playing around with said artstyle and expirmenting with a 'combo' like system which never made it far </div><br><br>

        <div style ="margin:auto; width: 70%;">Board the Ship was a lot of things. It was meant to be a pirate fighting ship raiding game. The idea was players had the choice to wield 3 weapons and even duel-wield them. AI was very new to me and I wanted to be a sandbox style where the player has freedom to kill however they wanted. I might return to this idea as there's surely some treasure in there! </div><br><br>

            It was an Mulitplayer looter shooter where players would join the hub and create missons/servers for others to join and play. It's extremely unpolished and needs a lot of work..
            But if I ignore all of that the game was pretty much at the content stage. I've tried going back to the project via restarting but none of those got anywhere close to this stage. I'll come back to this some day!</div><br><br>
